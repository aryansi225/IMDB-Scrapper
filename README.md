# IMDB-Scrapper
Scrapper to scrape top 250 movies page of IMDB

A spider is built using scraping library Scrapy which crawls through the IMDB top 250 movies webpage (https://www.imdb.com/chart/top) and gets back the names, rating, directors, genre and the cast in JSON format.

Using this scraped data exploratory data analysis and visualization was done to find the number of movies in each genre or cast members common in these top 250 films.

# Screenshots

Visualization done as part of EDA.
